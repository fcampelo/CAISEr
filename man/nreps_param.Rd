\description{
Iteratively calculates the required sample sizes for two algorithms
on a given problem instance using the \strong{parametric} approach
(based on normality of the sampling distribution of the means)
so that the standard error
of the estimate of the difference (either simple or percent) in mean
performance is controlled at a predefined level.

\section{Instances and Algorithms}{

Parameters \code{instance}, \code{algorithm1} and \code{algorithm2} must each
be a list of instance (algorithm) specifications, defined according to the
instructions given below.

\code{instance} is a named list containing all relevant parameters that
define the problem instance. This list must contain at least the field
\code{instance$name}, with the name of the problem instance function, that is, a
routine that calculates y = f(x). If the instance requires additional
parameters, these must also be provided as named fields.

Similarly, \code{algorithm1} and \code{algorithm2} must each be a named list
containing all relevant parameters that define the algorithm to be applied
for solving the problem instance. In what follows we use \code{algorithm} to
refer to both \code{algorithm1} and \code{algorithm2}

\code{algorithm} must contain a \code{algorithm$name} field (the name
of the function that calls the algorithm) and any other elements/parameters
that \code{algorithm$name} requires (e.g., stop criteria, operator names and
parameters, etc.).

The function defined by the routine \code{algorithm$name} must have the
following structure: supposing that the list in \code{algorithm} has
fields \code{algorithm$name = myalgo} and
\code{algorithm$par1 = "a", algorithm$par2 = 5}, then:

\preformatted{
         myalgo <- function(par1, par2, instance, ...){
               # do stuff
               # ...
               return(results)
         }
   }

That is, it must be able to run if called as:

\preformatted{
         # remove '$name' field from list of arguments
         # and include the problem definition as field 'instance'
         myargs          <- algorithm[names(algorithm) != "name"]
         myargs$instance <- instance

         # call function
         do.call(algorithm$name,
                 args = myargs)
   }

The \code{algorithm$name} routine must return a list containing (at
least) the performance value of the final solution obtained, in a field named
\code{value} (e.g., \code{result$value}) after a given run.
}

\section{Initial Number of Observations}{

In the \strong{general case} the initial number of observations / algorithm /
instance (\code{nstart}) should be relatively high. For the parametric case
we recommend ~20 if outliers are not expected, ~50 (at least) if that
assumption cannot be made. For the bootstrap approch we recommend using at
least 20. However, if some distributional assumptions can be
made - particularly low skewness of the population of algorithm results on
the test instances), then \code{nstart} can in principle be as small as 5 (if the
output of the algorithm were known to be normal, it could be 1).

In general, higher sample sizes are the price to pay for abandoning
distributional assumptions. Use lower values of \code{nstart} with caution.
}

\section{Types of Differences}{

Parameter \code{dif} informs the type of difference in performance to be used
for the estimation (mu1 and mu2 represent the mean performance of each
algorithm on the problem instance):
\itemize{
\item If \code{dif == "perc"} it estimates (mu2 - mu1) / mu1.
\item If \code{dif == "simple"} it estimates mu2 - mu1.
}
