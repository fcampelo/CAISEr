Legacy code for version 0.3.3 of the R package _CAISEr_, with routines for automatically 
determining the sample size needed for performing comparative experiments with 
two algorithms on several instances.

To install this version directly from Github, simply type:

```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("fcampelo/CAISEr@v0.3.3")
```

The most recent CRAN release of the package is also available for installation directly 
from the R prompt, using:

```
install.packages("CAISEr")
```

For instructions and examples of use, please take a look at the vignette 
_Adapting Algorithms for CAISEr_, and at the package documentation, particularly 
functions `run_experiment()` and `run_nreps2()`.

Please send any bug reports, questions, suggestions, chocolate or beers 
directly to the package authors listed at the top of this document.

Cheers,  
Felipe
